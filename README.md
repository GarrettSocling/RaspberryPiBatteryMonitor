# Smart Battery Monitor for IoT Devices
The novelty of the research project was to develop a web application to remotely monitor the battery usage level and device information of an Internet of Things (IoT) network of four Raspberry Pis connected to the network using Java. Used Play framework in association with MySQL database and Arbor.js, a visualization library using web workers and jQuery for remote access through web.

The application was deployed in the Ubuntu server and the server was managed using Ubuntu Canonical.

Collabrations to improve the algorithm/application is much appreciated!
